This system is using MAVEN and JAVA programming language. This system used JSOUP to get data from https://github.com/STIW3054-A191/Main-Issues/issues/1 and https://github.com/STIW3054-A191/Assignments/wiki/List_of_Student. Then save the data to the EXCEL file by using APACHE POI. Another that, the system can read the EXCEL file and print out into the table form for List of Students and List of Issues. And then, compare two sheets of data and print out the Submitted Students, Submitted Students but not in students list and Not Submitted Students. After that, the system also can open the EXCEL file.
